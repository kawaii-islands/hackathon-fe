                The first Kawaiiverse Hackathon: Building the Kawaiiverse gaming ecosystem is a
                playground for game developers around the world. The contest has no limit on
                contestants' age and game genre, can be NFT or traditional game so the teams can

                addition to the initial reward of 5,000 USD for each chosen team (no
