        Kawaiiverse is an Anime Metaverse co-founded in 2021 by <b>Imba</b>, a
        leading game company with years of game developing experience and
        multiple successful games including Kawaii Mansion, Kawaii Home
        Design,... and <b>Oraichain</b>, the world's first intelligent and
        secure solution for emerging Web3, scalable Dapps, and decentralized AI.
        With the target to keep building, maintaining and expanding the Anime
        Metaverse, Kawaiiverse will continuously roll out new events and
        programs to incubate the ecosystem development, especially the
        co-development from our talented and creative community members.
      </p>
      <p>
        In anticipation of the recently launched Kawaiiverse subnet on
        Oraichain, our Kawaii team is holding an exciting playground for games,
        especially NFT gaming developers and content creators all around the
        world. For many years, Blockchain technology has created an innovative
        environment for thousands of projects all over the world with the nature
        of its decentralized and trustless environment. Thanks to the
        decentralized nature of blockchain, the community has had the
        opportunity to play as one of the most important drivers to a project’s
        success and by recruiting more talented teams, our community will be

          Kawaiiverse Hackathon 2022: Building the Kawaiiverse gaming ecosystem.
        </b>
      </p>
      <h2>The building of Kawaiiverse - Open environment for development</h2>
      <p>
        Kawaiiverse is built in anticipation of an Anime Metaverse, where
        everyone can play, create, connect and earn. With this clear intention
        of making it easy for independent developers joining Kawaiiverse, the
        subnetwork is a Cosmos-based chain with full Ethereum Virtual Machine
        (EVM) support — a scalable and interoperable Ethereum, built on
        Proof-of-Stake with fast-finality. This nature allows easy and secured
        development, which will also be supported with the in-coming Kawaiiverse
        developers tools, to be privately shared to all eligible developers in
        the initial phase and later on, expanding to community creators.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kawaiiverse is currently supporting Metamask, one of the most popular
        tools for wallet management, taking less burden on the integration
        process for developers. In the near future, we will also support
        Owallet, a new wallet for versatile interactions between several chains
        (Oraichain Mainnet 2.0, Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, Juno, Ethereum, BNB Chain,
        and more). This integration is promised to serve the swift transition
        between 2 chains Kawaiiverse is currently supporting: BNBChain and
        custom subnetwork on Oraichain, allowing our players to perform all
        Kawaiiverse interactions with their phone only.
      </p>
      <p>
        With gas fee being one of the biggest challenges for blockchain games,
        Kawaiiverse is running for free, with 0 gas fee and only a small amount
        of ORAIE required to activate the wallet. These features will be great
        advantages for new developers to participate in building Kawaiiverse
        with their own content. So, what kind of benefits will the participating
        teams earn joining Kawaiiverse Hackathon 2022?
