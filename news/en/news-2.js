        <h1> How we select a candidate</h1>
        <p>The selection of candidates will go through 3 phases:</p>
        <i>Phase 1: Feasibility verification (1 month)</i>
        <p>
          Based on the proposal of each team, we will select innovative ideas to
          carry on. Technical feasibility and sounding business with high social
          impact are two keys to convince our selection board.
        </p>
        <i>Phase 2: Discussion with Advisory Board (1–2 months)</i>
        <p>
          A selected candidate from phase 1 can go on face-to-face meetings with
          our Advisory Board to present and optimize their execution plan.
        </p>
        <i> Phase 3: Execution (1 month — 3 years)</i>
        <p>
          At this phase, the actual hard work will begin. Project execution will
          go from 1 month to 3 years depending on the complexity of the DApps.
          Throughout this period, Oraichain will closely monitor the development
          and perform our commitment.
