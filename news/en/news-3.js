      <p>
        Oraichain is the world’s first blockchain platform that focuses on the
        integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into smart contracts by
        inventing a unique AI Oracle mechanism. With the ambition to become a
        disruptive pioneer as AI Layer 1 for Data Economy & Oracle services in
        the blockchain landscape, Oraichain constantly strives to offer a
        stable, secure, and high-throughput infrastructure to power a complete
        AI x Blockchain ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the official launch of Oraichain Mainnet 1.0 in February 2021,
        Oraichain has been working consistently to bring out more advanced
        upgrades so as to complete and secure the ecosystem at a top-notch
        level. With the latest upgrade to Oraichain Mainnet 2.0 in March 2022,
        Oraichain network is now ready to not only serve both native and
        cross-chain services, but also to connect blockchains within Cosmos,
        Ethereum, BSC and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are here to probe deep into 6 core technologies that together play
        crucial parts in Oraichain’s destinal mission to the future of AI x
        Blockchain:
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>1. AI Layer 1</h2>
      </p>

      <p>
        Based on the grounds of Cosmos SDK and Tendermint Core of the Cosmos
        ecosystem, Oraichain Mainnet 2.0 has top-notch levels of security and
        transaction processing speed. Oraichain also inherits IBC (Inter-chain
        Communication protocol) and further adapts the protocol to communicate
        to chains within the Cosmos ecosystem and to other networks.
        Significantly, Oraichain develops its own advanced modules for the
        integration of AI into smart contracts. We will release these modules as
        open sources as soon they reach the stable version.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h2>2. AI Oracle</h2>
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>
          AI Oracle is the heart of the transformation that Oraichain is
          building.
        </i>
        AI Oracle is (can be thought as) a “little smarter” oracle mechanism to
        deliver data to smart contracts since it “smartly” puts the processing
        of any data to the test — not just aggregates the data sources. Future
        applications will necessarily compute a lot of complex data to handle
        more and more complex business, and blindly trusting outputs of AI
        models to externally process those data will be out of the question.
      </p>

      <p>
        AI Oracle is innovatively designed with a decentralized testing protocol
        to validate Robustness, Accuracy and Execution of an AI model. Only
        models that pass the test can further compute the input and broadcast
        outputs as data sources to smart contracts. The test results are stored
        on-chain as Proofs of execution and accuracy. Future investigation can
        scan any transactions to know how the actions were derived with which AI
        APIs and how good it was at the time.
      </p>

      <p>
        While centralized AI services are inevitable since providing AI APIs
        will continuously be a major business. The validation of such AI models
        is also inevitable for any Web3 applications to reach the full state of
        decentralization. Oraichain’s AI Oracle mechanism is surely a necessity.
        Testing protocol of AI Oracle is done via Testcases. There are several
        kinds of testcases data and many strategies, which try to validate as
        many aspects of AI models as possible. (We’ll cover this topic in a
        special article. Stay tuned!)
      </p>

        In the meantime, we are calling for 200+ AI Executors on AI Execution
        Subnetwork. Check it out{" "}

        <h2>3. Decentralized Data and AI</h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        Oraichain establishes decentralized environments for the data economy
        and AI services, including Oraichain Data Hub, Data Marketplace, and AI
        Marketplace — powered by Oraichain Mainnet 2.0. These services emphasize
        the ownerships, creatorships, and their incentives t while contributing
        to the global ecosystem of Data and AI via data generation and provision
        of AI services amid the irresistible waving of Web3. Oraichain Data Hub
        is also a significant platform to carry out the completion of Testcases
        for AI Oracle in a decentralized and crowdsourcing-based manner.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h2>4. Scale-up with Rollups</h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        Network scaling appears to be a critical limitation of many blockchain
        networks. At Oraichain, we optimize two prominent scale-up solutions,
        Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups, to increase the transaction
        throughput on Oraichain Mainnet 2.0. This allows a series of sub-chains
        (sub-networks) that run various decentralized applications to connect
        with the main chain without common transaction processing hindrances
        like network congestion or unexpectedly sky-high gas fees.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h2>5. CosmWasm IDE</h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cosmos ecosystem is rapidly expanding with over 263 projects and
        many well-known billion-dollar projects like Terra, Cronos, Osmosis,
        Cosmos Hub — to name a few. The groundbreaking IBC lets all chains in
        the ecosystem communicate easily with each other, which makes the
        ecosystem even stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oraichain team has collaborated with CosmWasm to introduce CosmWasm IDE
        for developers to accelerate the smart contracting of their projects on
        Cosmos ecosystem. The CosmWasm IDE is a developer-friendly environment
        that helps project developers write code, run tests, detect errors, and
        share common modules more conveniently and faster. Read more about
        Oraichain x CosmWasm partnership and CosmWasm IDE{" "}

      <p>
        <h2>6. EVM Compatibility:</h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        Oraichain develops independent sub-networks that are completely
        compatible with Ethereum network and BNB Chain (formerly Binance Smart
        Chain). This means that developers on Ethereum and BSC can easily switch
        to Oraichain Mainnet 2.0 with cheaper transaction fees (~$0) and higher
        throughput for their dApps.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s a brief introduction to understand the core technologies of
        Oraichain. We hope you’ve had a good read and even hope you’ve gained
        some insights of how the decentralization problem of AI for Blockchain
        needs to be solved and how we’re intending to solve it. AI Oracle is
        only a “little smarter” oracle than other conventional oracles —
        however, it requires a whole new & innovative ecosystem and essentially,
        it’s inevitable.
