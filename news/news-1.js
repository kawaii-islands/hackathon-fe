        Kawaiiverse is an Anime Metaverse co-founded in 2021 by Imba, a leading
        game company with years of game developing experience and multiple
        successful games including Kawaii Mansion, Kawaii Home Design,… and
        Oraichain, the world’s first intelligent and secure solution for
        emerging Web3, scalable Dapps, and decentralized AI. With the target to
        keep building, maintaining and expanding the Anime Metaverse,
        Kawaiiverse will continuously roll out new events and programs to
        incubate the ecosystem development, especially the co-development from
        our talented and creative community members.
      </p>
      <p>
        In anticipation of the recently launched Kawaiiverse subnet on
        Oraichain, our Kawaii team is holding an exciting playground for games,
        especially NFT gaming developers and content creators all around the
        world. For many years, Blockchain technology has created an innovative
        environment for thousands of projects all over the world with the nature
        of its decentralized and trustless nature. Thanks to the
        decentralization nature of blockchain, the community has had the
        opportunity to play as one of the most important drivers to a project’s
        success. The Hackathon, along with the on-going registration for
        K-Ambassadors will initiate the start of Kawaiiverse’ second phase of
        Create to own and earn. Now, let’s find out more about the Kawaiiverse
        Hackathon 2022: Building the Kawaiiverse gaming ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        This proposal is on hold to collect community feedback before officially
        starting this June. Feel free to share your opinion and discuss where we
        can improve to hold a better hackathon for our community’s mutual
        benefit.

      <h2>The building of Kawaiiverse — Open environment for development</h2>
      <p>
        Kawaiiverse is built in anticipation of an Anime Metaverse, where
        everyone can play, create, connect and earn. With this clear intention
        of making it easy for independent developers joining Kawaiiverse, the
        subnetwork is a Cosmos-based chain with full Ethereum Virtual Machine
        (EVM) support — a scalable and interoperable Ethereum, built on
        Proof-of-Stake with fast-finality. This nature allows easy and secured
        development, which will also be supported with the in-coming Kawaiiverse
        developers tools, to be privately shared to all eligible developers in
        the initial phase and later on, expanding to community creators.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kawaiiverse is currently supporting Metamask, one of the most popular
        tools for wallet management, taking less burden on the integration
        process for developers. In the near future, we will also support
        Owallet, a new wallet for versatile interactions between several chains
        (Oraichain Mainnet 2.0, Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, Juno, Ethereum, BNB Chain,
        and more). This integration is promised to serve the swift transition
        between 2 chains Kawaiiverse is currently supporting: BNBChain and
        custom subnetwork on Oraichain, allowing our players to perform all
        Kawaiiverse interactions with their phone only.
      </p>

      <p>
        With gas fee being one of the biggest challenges for blockchain games,
        Kawaiiverse is running for free, with 0 gas fee and only a small amount
        of ORAIE required to activate the wallet. These features will be great
        advantages for new developers to participate in building Kawaiiverse
        with their own content. So, what kind of benefits will the participating
        teams earn joining Kawaiiverse Hackathon 2022?
      </p>
