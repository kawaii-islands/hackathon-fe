      <h2>Q1 — Upgrade core game & Expand to Anime Metaverse</h2>
      <p>
        Spending the first 3 months of 2022 focusing on improving the
        Kawaiiverse core game — Kawaii Islands and introducing the related
        concepts, our team and community has gone through multiple obstacles in
        the path of balancing and improving the gaming mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        On February 11, Kawaii Islands team introduced the first Kawaii DAO at
        the official DAO portal:{" "}
        <a href="https://vote.kawaii.global/" target="_blank">
          https://vote.kawaii.global/
        </a>
        . Following Kawaiians’ request, our DAO was re-designed and now running
        smoothly for all $KWT balances in holders’ wallets or locked in staking.
        In the near future, when Kawaiiverse island NFTs are officially minted
        and applied, these NFTs will also be assigned a certain amount of KWT
        Voting Power to join DAO. As official citizens of Kawaiiverse, these
        island owners will have their fair share of voting power.

        Kawaii Islands officially introduced our{" "}
        <a href="https://kawaii.onelink.me/rqpO/social" target="_blank">
          mobile apps
        </a>{" "}
        to the public on March 30,2022 on both Android and IOS. Introducing the
        new Transient generation of essential gaming items, the Trading pass and
        Kawaii League, Kawaii Islands is adding more game play activities so
        that our players, crypto or not, can enjoy the playing experience.
        Though many things in the new economy still need to be followed and
        rebalanced if needed as the first season goes on, we believe the new
        system will bring great benefits to our community. With more and more
        gaming content being introduced, our game strives to gradually hook and
        convert traditional gamers into the blockchain world. And Kawaii Islands
        is not our last stop, Kawaiiverse will be the central hub for multiple
        games from both the Kawaii team and independent developers who choose to
        join Kawaiiverse with our infrastructure support. In Q2 2022,{" "}
        <b>Kawaii Fishing Saga</b> will be the first minigame to be added into
        Kawaiiverse and Kawaiiverse islands owners will be among the first
        people to enjoy access to the minigame. To learn more about KFS concept,

        On March 22, Kawaii Islands started our first islands presale with the
        help of{" "}
        <a href="http://bit.ly/3srmDC3" target="_blank">
          Polinate
        </a>
        , selling 114 islands from 3 different tiers in the Mecha Plain
        Archipelago. The island owners in Kawaiiverse will have the rights to
        purchase tools machines to craft KFS items being used for gaming. Other
        than that, the exclusive islands NFTs are unique based on ERC-721
        contracts, giving each owner their own location and identity in
        Kawaiiverse with multiple rights, including the attached Mecha Plain
        island skin and fashion items, pre-opened small house, DAO rights as
        mentioned above and the right to place ads on their islands in the
        future. Polinate is our first presale partner and with the intention of
        breaking into different communities in mind, other presale events will
        go live soon. Stay tuned!

        With many activities going on for the first quarter of 2022, and the
        introduction of the new economy for a better, healthier Kawaiiverse
        economy, Q1 was a big step in reviving our Kawaii community. However,
        with the big workload, one important part of Kawaii Islands was sadly
        delayed. The introduction of the Tailor feature and Daily shop were
        delayed to Q2. Now, let’s take a look at the Kawaiiverse focus of Q2,
        2022.
      </p>
      <h2>Q2 — Kawaiiverse infrastructure and Extending Gaming Experience</h2>
      <img src="/images/library/kawaiiverse-map.png" />
      <p>
        Our Kawaii team also introduced the{" "}

          target="_blank"
        >
          Kawaiiverse concept
        </a>{" "}
        this year, making the official debut of the immersive Anime Metaverse.
        With the whole ecosystem designed to focus on creating a seamless and
        interactive social experience for all Kawaiians, Kawaiiverse is starting
        its foundational infrastructure to prepare for the expansion of the new
        world, where everyone can play, create, connect and earn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kawaiiverse and our Kawaii team believe that the metaverse experience
        and blockchain technology should not be available to just on-boarded
        crypto enthusiasts, the whole world and ordinary people should also be
        able to have an easy way to approach and adopt as well. With
        Kawaiiverse, our team dreams of adding our share in increasing worldwide
        adoption. Kawaiiverse infrastructure will be the easy and simple set of
        tools that can allow traditional creators and developers to join crypto
        through Kawaiiverse with their content, and earn from it while adding
        variety to our ecosystem. And converting the end user, or players is
        another part of the plan which our mobile versions are being the lead
        attraction factor with higher spread.
      </p>
      <h2>In Q2, 2022, Kawaiiverse will focus on:</h2>
      <h3>
        1. Building and testing the Kawaiiverse infrastructure, easy sets of

        and rooting for us despite the hard times and always share their ideas
