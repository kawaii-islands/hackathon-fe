        Kawaiiverse is built on the foundation of creating a central hub for
        Anime fanatics and lovers around the world to join and create a friendly
        environment where everything and anything is possible. Let’s take a
        closer look at our magical world.
      </p>
      <h2>The Central Town — Kawaii islands and more</h2>
      <p>
        In the core of Kawaiiverse, we have the <b>Community Isle</b>, which
        convey the ultimate meaning of our vision in building a greater
        community. Community Isle will be the central area where our Kawaiians
        hang out in their free time, join special events and interact with each
        other as well as businesses that joined our Metaverse. The Community
        Isle will be the wonderland for players to join and communicate with
        each other, expanding our e-social interaction with people who share the
        same interest. Being the heart of our community, the Community Island is
        located in the center of a KWT shaped region and surrounded by 4 Kawaii
        Hometown archipelagos: Nyow Terrain, Springdew Valley, Mecha Plains and
        Diamond Harbor.
      </p>
      <p>
        These <b>Hometown archipelagos</b> will be the gateway to our core game,
        Kawaii Islands, where our Kawaiians build their home and produce
        essential materials for Kawaiiverse. Each residential area in the
        Hometown reign represents a unique group of Kawaiians with different
        styles and hobbies. There is a total of 31,415 residential islands in
        Kawaiiverse, locating all over the 4 main archipelagos. Each island will
        be a unique NFT with special rights and perks in Kawaiiverse. Now, let’s
        zoom in at each of the archipelagos:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Nyow Terrain — The town of Animal lovers:</b> Located in the north of
        the Kawaiiverse with diverse topography, this archipelago is ideal for
        various magical creatures to dwell in. As a result, residents of this
        region are experts in taking care of their magical companions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Springdew Valley — The land of the green panthers:</b> Also known as
        the islands of eternal spring, this green land is blessed with perfect
        weather to cultivate magical plants all year round. The most renowned
        botanists reside here, and spread their knowledge to cultivate the
        plants in the most efficient way to the entire region.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/library/springdew.jpeg" />
      <p>
        <b>Mecha Plains — Mechanics’ dream town:</b> The harsh nature and
        inclement climate turns this region into the dwelling of only the most
        resourceful people. Inhabitants of this archipelago are famous for their
        skills in creative engineering and manufacturing.
      </p>

        most prestigious, wealthy merchants with brilliant business strategies.

      <h2>The ever-expanding Kawaiiverse</h2>
      <p>
        Surrounding the Community Island and the Hometown area are other
        Kawaiiverse utility islands. While the{" "}
        <b>
          <i>Marketplacemar</i>
        </b>{" "}
        is familiar to most players for now, we will update it to accommodate
        the marketplace of all games in Kawaiiverse in the future.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/library/marketplace.png" />
      <p>
        The <b>DeFi Island</b> will direct players to the current aiRight
        staking portal for KWT and MILKY. Once the infrastructure is completed
        and our system is ready, other DeFi services will be able to join and
        open a fully decentralized financial town in Kawaiiverse.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/library/defi.png" />
      <p>
        Another island coming soon to Kawaiiverse is our <b>Fishingvilles</b>,
        where Kawaiians enjoy conquering unique marine life with their fishing
        skills. This will be the first minigame to be introduced to the
        Kawaiiverse world.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/library/fishing.png" />
      <p>
        <b>Adventure Ruins</b>, a faraway fantasy ruins for the brave Kawaiians
        to explore and fight intimidating monsters with their advanced Magical
        Creatures.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another fun stop in Kawaiiverse will be <b>Funland Center</b>, the
        entertainment center with plenty of real-time minigames, quizzes and
        interactive riddles that Kawaiians can enjoy solving together.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/library/funland.png" />
      <p>
        One unique feature where Kawaiians can both open their own
        restaurants/cafeteria/bars… and serve food and beverages to other
        Kawaiians, we call it the <b>F&B Districts</b>.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/library/district.png" />
      <p>
        Being a decentralized project and KWT as the governance token,
        Kawaiiverse aims to run its important decisions through DAO and testing
        out this feature through Kawaii Islands. <b>DAO governance</b> is the
        ruling center for this.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/library/dao.png" />
      <p>
        Letting new players understand the concept and gameplay of Kawaii
        Islands as well as other coming games in Kawaiiverse, the <b>Academy</b>{" "}
        will be the most useful stop in one’s journey to explore Kawaiiverse.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/library/academy.png" />
      <p>
        And last but not least, we will have a <b>Creative Studio</b> for
        players to self design the game content, other gaming utilities such as
        decoration, fashion items and more through the help of our
        infrastructure. The infrastructure tools will be a great companion for
        all creators and studios to focus on the creation part. The old boring
        part of implementing their art into our Kawaiiverse will be taken care
        of.
