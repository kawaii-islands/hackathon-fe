    "Kawaii Islands aims to be the first Anime Metaverse in the space for anime games, arts, and creative fans — starting with the first game “Kawaii Islands”, introduced on September 30, 2021. The year 2022 will mark a major leap of Kawaii Islands into Kawaiiverse — with a full set of blockchain infrastructure for game publishers, NFT creators, and many social features on a virtual community space. Many exciting games will come into Kawaiiverse to perform its “play, create, connect, and earn” vision.",

      <h2>Kawaiiverse’s long term vision</h2>
      <h3>Kawaii Islands — “play, create, connect, and earn”</h3>
      <p>
        Kawaii Islands brings a whole set of gaming experiences to players with
        farming, decorating and styling for thousands of high quality gaming
        resources. Along with the current game loop, Kawaii Islands as well as
        the Kawaiiverse will introduce other gameplay to the ecosystem such as
        fishing game (Alpha test this year), Adventure game (fight with your
        Creatures) or Kawaii Islands real time minigames. Built for the
        community and work for the community, Kawaii Islands vision is not just
        about play to earn, create to earn and connecting people are also
        important drives of Kawaii Islands as a game and Kawaiiverse as the
        ecosystem.
      </p>
      <h3>Infrastructure for game publishers and content creators</h3>
      <p>
        And the ecosystem will not stop with our in-house games, creators will
        later get infrastructure support to join and create games/NFTs in Kawaii
        Islands Metaverse, bringing more unique content to our system. Kawaii
        Islands aims to build an all-inclusive system where every talented
        creator can join and create to earn. Kawaii Islands will grow as a
        nurturing hub for creators and anime studios in the blockchain space,
        empowering quality products with original creations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2022, Kawaii Islands will initiate the building of Kawaiiverse
        foundational infrastructure for creators. Our long term target is to
        develop and provide creators, publishers, studios with a full set of
        tools for content and apps development in blockchain, allowing everyone
        to to start their on-chain business in Kawaiiverse. The developed
        infrastructure will enable artists and developers to incorporate their
        products to Kawaiiverse, serve the community and earn.
      </p>
      <h3>A strong community of players and enthusiasts</h3>
      <p>
        One of Kawaii Islands’ core values is building an engaging community for
        players and anime fans around the world. Proud to be one of the rare
        blockchain games that focus on creating actual game play with high
        quality graphics and immersive activities, Kawaii Islands aims to create
        a healthy and active environment for everyone to play and connect.
        Despite being a young community, many connections and great friendships
        formed from Kawaii Islands, especially, we could name a VC that was
        formed by Kawaii Islands players who met through the game and started
        the VC to invest in blockchain technology, K-Venture. Great community
        and life long friendship can form and grow together with the Kawaii
        Islands ecosystem.

        In Q2 2022, <b>“infrastructure as a service”</b> will be implemented and
        ready for adoption of new games and minigames on Kawaiiverse. The
        infrastructure for publishing new games to Kawaiiverse will support (1)
        on-chain processes on both BSC and Oraichain network like NFT creation,
        marketplace, transaction history, (2) common DeFi mechanisms like
        staking/bonding or bridging, (3) communication protocols between games
        for social activity exchange, and (4) general interfaces for analytics
        like dashboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Q3 2022, <b>“protocols for creators”</b> will be ready. Creators and
        anime artists around the world can use these protocols to create anime
        fashion, characters, content and share with the Kawaiiverse community to
        earn their privilege, appreciation and cryptocurrencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Q4 2022, some <b>AI-based personalization features</b> will be
        introduced and with the readiness of the infrastructure and protocols,
        Kawaiiverse will be <b>available for enterprises</b> to join our
        business.

      <p>
        With all actions set out for the year 2022, Kawaiiverse will promisingly
        deliver more engaging gaming and creating experiences for players and
        creators. The development plan is expected to activate and define the
        first ever, create-to-earn Anime Metaverse for blockchain. With endless
        creativity from creators and Anime fans around the world, the
        Kawaiiverse will build a never ending metaverse on the clouds for all.
