    "Kawaiiverse subnetwork is going live this month, setting the foundation for an Anime Metaverse where everyone can play, create, connect and earn. The subnetwork will be the hub for all independent creators and developers to join and create to earn with ready-to-use tools provided by the Kawaii team. In today’s episode, let’s discover what this subnetwork is and its unlimited potential.",

      <h2>The basic concept of the Kawaiiverse subnet</h2>
      <p>
        Kawaiiverse infrastructure vision was initially introduced back in
        January this year with the ambition to develop Kawaii Islands into the
        core game of a bigger and more complex Anime Metaverse. Kawaiiverse
        subnetwork will be a Cosmos-based chain with full Ethereum Virtual
        Machine (EVM) support — a scalable and interoperable Ethereum, built on
        Proof-of-Stake with fast-finality. In the early stage of Kawaiiverse,
        the Oraichain members of Kawaii team will run 4Genesis nodes (and call
        for Community Validators later on).
      </p>
      <p>
        With the fast growing ecosystem, Oraichain is improving its ability to
        assist users in smooth interchain interactions, from the OraiBrigde
        which allows swift interchain assets movements, the first ever on-chain
        VRF feature to the OraiDex which allow users to swap tokens at low cost.
        Oraichain has indeed evolved into an AI Layer 1 with more
        interoperability and scalability, getting ready for dApps developers and
        Kawaiiverse will be the first to join and take advantage of these
        services.
      </p>
      <h2>Kawaiiverse Subnet Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Network name: Kawaiiverse Subnet</li>
        <li>
          Consensus: Delegated Proof-of-Stake, with validators and delegators
        </li>
        <li>Delegated token: ORAIE (E for EVM), 1 ORAIE = 1 ORAI</li>
        <li>
          Kawaiiverse DAO power: to be applied later with KWT as the governance
          token, the current DAO on{" "}
          <a href="https://vote.kawaii.global/" target="_blank">
            https://vote.kawaii.global/
          </a>{" "}
          will be kept until the DAO on Oraichain is ready.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>The future infrastructure and growing potential</h2>
      <h3>1. The Kawaii gaming experience</h3>
      <p>
        The island owners of Kawaiiverse will be the first to own NFTs on the
        Kawaiiverse subnet. With the subnetwork getting ready to be released
        soon, Kawaiiverse residents will be able to claim their own islands as
        unique NFTs (ERC-721). Each residential area in the Hometown reigns has
        special rights and perks, not only applied in Kawaii Islands but also
        affecting other games like the upcoming Kawaii Fishing Saga and many
        more in the later phases.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the Kawaiiverse subnetwork goes into operation, the Kawaii Islands
        Marketplace, Renting services and more will be applied with seamless
        interaction and ground-level network fee. The gaming experience for
        users in certain restricted areas will also have a chance to be
        improved, leaving the RPC error behind our Kawaiiverse.
      </p>
      <h3>2. The independent developers’ chance to join</h3>
      <p>
        With the initial subnetwork, our developers in the Kawaii team are also
        working on the Kawaiiverse tools set which allow creators and developers
        to join and create their own content in Kawaiiverse. In the earlier
        phase, the tools will be available for a selective group of partners,
        who we can verify and set certain rights to operate in the best of
        players’ rights and benefits. As the ecosystem grows and the rules
        become stronger, individuals and smaller developers will have the
        opportunity to join and publish their own content in a more open manner.
        Kawaiiverse is set to grow into an open environment for the community to
        freely express themselves and contribute to the wealth of the whole
        community.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the near future, our members in the Kawaii team are preparing an
        exciting Kawaiiverse program that allows small projects and independent
        groups of developers to nurture their talent, ideas and dreams with our
        team and community. Stay tuned for more information and see you all in
        Kawaii Islands!
